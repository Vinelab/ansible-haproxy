## Synopsis
Installs haproxy and configures backends and frontends, also includes the default haproxy configuration but will use ```templates/haproxy.cfg.j2``` in the process.

Make sure to have the ACL titles unique as they will be used as match conditions. i.e.
```title: static``` with acl ```path_beg -i /static /images /javascript /stylesheets``` will result in
```
acl is_static path_beg -i /static /images /javascript /stylesheets
use_backend static if is_static
```
